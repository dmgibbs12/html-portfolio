<h1>The Best Movies According to D'Andre</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it reminded me of when I had my first dog 
   when I was out on my own. We had a bond, and that was something I 
   always cherished like what was developed throughout the movie between
Hiccup and Toothless.</p>
<h3>Captain America: Winter Soldier</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Marvel movie that came out during Marvel's peak. 
   it had great storytelling, mystery, and Captian America is one of my
   favorite super heroes of all-time. It was also cool to see Bucky return
   in the movie too. I also really enjoyed those fight scenes they had throughout
   the movie as well.

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>John Wick was awesome! Even though they killed a dog in the movie (fake I know)
   it was a great revenge story. Also seeing the gunplay in that movie from Keanu 
   Reeves was great as well.  </p>
